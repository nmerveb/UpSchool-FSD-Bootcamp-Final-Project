### Project Scenario
This project involves developing a web bot application based on the client's request. The bot will be used to scrape specific competitor products and classify them using various filters. Additionally, the scraped products will be viewable on a dashboard and can be saved as an Excel file. The bot will have the capability to send in-app notifications and emails to the user upon completion of the scraping process. The project will be designed with a customizable structure to meet the unique needs of users.
